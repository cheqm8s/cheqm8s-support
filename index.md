# CheqM8s Support

Welcome to CheqM8s support! We're here to help you split bills effortlessly.

## Getting Started

### How to Split a Bill

1. **Scan a Receipt**
   - Tap the camera icon
   - Take a photo of your receipt (take the photo just like you do when scanning documents for best results)
   - Items will be automatically extracted

2. **Assign Items**
   - Add people to your transaction
   - Each person selects their items
   - Tax and tip are split proportionally

3. **Track Settlements**
   - Mark when someone pays you
   - Keep track of who owes what

### Live Transactions

Perfect for ordering together:
- Start a live transaction before ordering
- Add items as you go
- Add tax and tip at the end
- No receipt needed!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do my friends need the app?
No! You can add temporary people and track what they owe without them having the app. However, if they have the app, you can invite them to collaborate on the transaction.

### How accurate is the receipt scanning?
Our scanner works best with clear, well-lit photos of receipts. Make sure the entire receipt is visible and the text is readable.

### Can I edit items after scanning?
Absolutely! You can add, edit, or remove items after scanning. You can also manually add items if the scanner misses anything.

### How do I invite friends?
You can search for friends by username or share a transaction link that they can open in the app.

### What if the receipt scan misses items?
You can manually add any missing items or edit existing ones. The scanner is a starting point - you have full control to adjust as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Receipt won't scan properly
- Ensure good lighting
- Hold camera steady
- Make sure entire receipt is in frame
- Try flattening crumpled receipts
- Clean your camera lens

### Can't find a friend
- Check spelling of their username
- Make sure they've completed onboarding
- They may be using a different username than expected

### Transaction calculations seem wrong
- Check if tax/tip percentages are correct
- Verify all items are assigned properly
- Make sure shared items are split correctly
